## What if…

…you could boost your lucky chances in Cobblemon based on your stats?

## Features

- Unlock bonuses to:
  - Hidden abilities
  - Perfect IVs
  - Shininess
- Unlock these bonuses when a Pokémon:
  - Spawns in the wild
  - Is fished up by a player
  - Hatches from an egg
  - Is revived from a fossil
  - Is captured by a player
- All bonuses are optional and highly configurable.
- Use *every* stat from the [Counter](https://www.notion.so/Counter-21d57e0d4afd80d0815fc97b89368998?pvs=21) mod
- Smart spawn reservation system prevents steal attempts in multiplayer
- Immersive in-game notifications when bonuses activate
- Whitelist/blacklist support for species/form control
- Optional form-aware tracking for regional variants
- Streak-breaking mechanics to maintain balance

## Testing

For the boosters, head over to [the config](https://www.notion.so/Config-Options-28357e0d4afd81e7b49ec62950b3830b?pvs=21) for the context you would like to test; for this example, we’re going to use the IV booster in a spawning context. Change the `debug` property to `true`, run the game, join a world. Run `/cobbled_counter set <player> capture streak <species> <form> 30`. Replace `<player>`  with your player name, `<species>` and `<form>` with something that spawns a lot nearby (for example, something like `/cobbled_counter set timinc capture streak wooloo normal 30`). Wait for the given Pokémon to spawn, and you should see Unchained's IV booster give feedback about the IVs that were perfected. While waiting, you should have also seen other debug lines go off describing how they failed.

## Known Issues

- v1.6.1-1.5.0 had set the event listeners to high priority, allowing other mods to override the results; notably running into [Fossil Tweaks](https://www.notion.so/Fossil-Tweaks-21d57e0d4afd8072ad0dcccb83f9fe2a?pvs=21)’s naive shiny rolling. v1.6.1-1.5.1 fixes this by deprioritizing the event listeners so they get last say.
